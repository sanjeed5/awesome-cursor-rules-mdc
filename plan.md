# Plan for Creating MDC Files from Library Best Practices

## Project Overview
Create a script that generates Cursor rule files (.mdc) for various libraries and frameworks based on their best practices. The script will leverage:
- Exa API for searching and retrieving library best practices
- LiteLLM with Gemini 2.0 Flash for enhancing and structuring content
- Existing utility functions from convert_to_mdc.py where applicable

## Implementation Steps

1. **Parse Libraries JSON**
   - Extract all libraries and frameworks from libraries.json
   - Create a flattened list of all technologies
   - Organize them by category for better file structure

2. **Set Up API Integration**
   - Configure Exa API client
   - Set up LiteLLM with proper rate limiting
   - Ensure proper error handling and retries

3. **Create Data Collection Pipeline**
   - For each library/framework:
     - Use Exa to search for best practices
     - Parse and clean the search results
     - If results are insufficient, enhance with Gemini 2.0 Flash

4. **Generate MDC Files**
   - Format data according to MDC file structure
   - Create appropriate glob patterns
   - Organize into logical categories

5. **Create File Structure**
   - Use categories from libraries.json (frontend, backend, etc.)
   - Name files according to library/framework (e.g., frontend/nextjs.mdc)
   - Save files to appropriate directories

6. **Implement Progress Tracking**
   - Track which libraries have been processed
   - Allow for resuming the process if interrupted

## File Structure
```
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.mdc
│   ├── nextjs.mdc
│   ├── vue.mdc
│   └── ...
├── backend/
│   ├── express.mdc
│   ├── django.mdc
│   └── ...
├── database/
│   ├── postgresql.mdc
│   ├── mongodb.mdc
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Execution Plan
1. Create main script that orchestrates the process
2. Implement utility functions for API interactions
3. Create MDC generation function based on convert_to_mdc.py
4. Test with a small subset of libraries
5. Run full generation process
6. Review and validate generated MDC files
